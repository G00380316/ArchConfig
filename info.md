The error message modprobe: FATAL: Module bbswitch not found in directory /lib/modules/6.10.3-arch1-2 means that bbswitch is not available for the current kernel (6.10.3). bbswitch is sometimes not compatible with newer kernels, which could be why it isn't working for you.

Since bbswitch isn't available, here are alternative steps to manage your NVIDIA GPU power usage:
Option 1: Switch to the LTS Kernel

As mentioned earlier, the LTS kernel is often more compatible with bbswitch and other power management tools. Here’s how to switch:

    Install the LTS kernel:

sudo pacman -S linux-lts linux-lts-headers

Rebuild bbswitch for the LTS kernel: If you don't already have it installed, you can do so:

yay -S bbswitch

Reboot your system and choose the LTS kernel from the bootloader menu.

Verify bbswitch works: After rebooting into the LTS kernel, try loading bbswitch again:

    sudo modprobe bbswitch
    cat /proc/acpi/bbswitch

Option 2: Use NVIDIA's Dynamic Power Management (DPM)

If switching to the LTS kernel is not an option or you prefer to stick with the newer kernel, you can configure NVIDIA Dynamic Power Management (DPM) to manage the GPU power state.

    Create or modify the nvidia.conf file:

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf

Add the following line to enable dynamic power management:

options nvidia NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x02

Regenerate initramfs:

sudo mkinitcpio -P

Reboot your system and verify GPU power is being managed: After rebooting, check the power status of the NVIDIA GPU:

    nvidia-smi

Option 3: Use PRIME Offloading

If you're using Bumblebee and bbswitch isn't working, you can use PRIME Offloading for GPU switching:

    Install nvidia-prime:

sudo pacman -S nvidia-prime

Set the integrated GPU as the default and offload tasks to the NVIDIA GPU when needed:

    __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"

    This will allow the system to use the integrated GPU by default, with offloading to the NVIDIA GPU when needed.

These alternatives should help with managing GPU power usage on your system, even without bbswitch. Let me know how it goes!

The output of nvidia-smi shows that the NVIDIA GPU (GeForce RTX 3050) is in a low power state with 9W usage and very minimal memory usage (1 MiB). This suggests that the GPU is not actively being used and is idle, which is a good sign for power efficiency.

Since you have the nvidia-smi output indicating that the GPU is using very little power, it seems like NVIDIA's power management is functioning well, even without additional configuration.

If you want to ensure that the GPU remains inactive when not needed and for further power savings, here are some additional steps you can consider:

    Ensure that NVIDIA Power Management is enabled: The nvidia driver should automatically manage the GPU's power state when it's idle, but if you want to make sure, you can enable NVIDIA Dynamic Power Management by following the steps I mentioned earlier.

    Use prime-select for switching GPUs: If you're not already using it, the prime-select utility can be used to switch between the integrated Intel GPU and the NVIDIA GPU. It helps ensure the NVIDIA GPU is only used when necessary.

    Optimize Xorg to avoid using the discrete GPU for the display: Ensure your Xorg configuration is set up to use the integrated GPU by default, which should reduce the power consumption of the NVIDIA GPU when the system is idle.

If you continue to see that the GPU is idle and drawing minimal power, these additional tweaks should further improve the power efficiency. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"
ChatGPT said:

The command you provided checks which GPU is being used for rendering by utilizing glxinfo with the __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 environment variable. This variable tells the system to offload rendering tasks to the NVIDIA GPU instead of using the integrated Intel GPU.

To run the command and check which GPU is being used for rendering, you can execute the following in your terminal:

__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"

This will display the GPU currently being used for OpenGL rendering. If the NVIDIA GPU is being used, it should show something like:

OpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 ...

If it's using the Intel GPU, it will show something like:

OpenGL renderer string: Intel(R) UHD Graphics ...

Let me know the output, and I can assist further!

It looks like the glxinfo command is not installed on your system. You can install it by installing the mesa-utils package, which contains glxinfo.

To install it on Arch Linux, run:

sudo pacman -S mesa-utils

After installing the package, you can run the __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer" command again to check which GPU is being used for rendering.

## Running a Script without Sudo

To run a script with sudo without requiring a password, you can configure sudoers to grant specific permissions for your user or group. Here's how:
Step 1: Edit the Sudoers File

Open the sudoers file using visudo:

sudo visudo

This ensures that the file is edited safely and prevents syntax errors that could lock you out.
Step 2: Add a Rule for Your Script

Add the following line to the sudoers file, replacing username with your actual username and script_path with the absolute path to your script:

username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/your/script.sh

For example:

enoch ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/enoch/scripts/tmux-sessioniser.sh

Step 3: Grant Permissions to Specific Commands

If the script uses a specific command (e.g., libinput), you can allow just that command instead of the whole script. For example:

username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/libinput

Step 4: Test the Configuration

Run the script or command with sudo to verify it works without a password:

sudo /path/to/your/script.sh

If the script still asks for a password, check:

    That the path in the sudoers file matches the script's exact path.
    The permissions of the script itself are executable (chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh).

Advanced: Run Without Explicit sudo in the Script

If you want the script to always execute commands with sudo seamlessly:

    Modify the script to call the specific command with sudo (e.g., sudo libinput).
    Use the sudoers rule for that command.

## Getting DisplayLink Working
You're welcome! Here’s a summary of the key commands used to get your DisplayLink working, with explanations for each:

    Install linux-headers for your kernel:

sudo pacman -S linux-headers

    Explanation: This installs the headers required to compile kernel modules for your current kernel version.

Install DisplayLink drivers:

yay -S displaylink

    Explanation: This command uses the AUR helper yay to install the DisplayLink drivers. This is necessary for DisplayLink devices to work on your system.

Remove and reinstall the evdi module:

sudo dkms remove evdi/1.14.7 --all
sudo dkms install evdi/1.14.7

    Explanation: These commands ensure that the evdi (the kernel module for DisplayLink) is installed and properly compiled for your kernel version.

Rebuild kernel modules:

sudo dkms autoinstall

    Explanation: This command rebuilds and installs all necessary kernel modules, including evdi.

Load the evdi module:

sudo modprobe evdi

    Explanation: This loads the evdi kernel module, which is required for DisplayLink devices to function correctly.

Start the DisplayLink service:

sudo systemctl start displaylink.service
sudo systemctl enable displaylink.service

    Explanation: These commands start and enable the DisplayLink service, ensuring that it starts on boot.

Verify the status of the DisplayLink service:

systemctl status displaylink.service

    Explanation: This command checks the status of the DisplayLink service to ensure it is running properly.

Allow root to access the display:

xhost +SI:localuser:root

    Explanation: This command allows root access to the X11 display, which is necessary when running displaylink_connect as root.

Check connected monitors:

    xrandr --listmonitors

        Explanation: This command lists the monitors that are currently detected and active.

You said:
can you also the command for checking the linux version and headers and why they  have to be the same
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here are the commands for checking your Linux version and kernel headers, along with an explanation of why they need to match:
Commands to Check the Linux Kernel Version and Headers:

    Check the Linux Kernel Version:

uname -r

    Explanation: This command displays the version of the currently running kernel. It outputs something like 6.12.1-arch1-1, which is important because it tells you which kernel you're using, and therefore which version of the kernel headers you need.

Check the Installed Kernel Headers:

    pacman -Q linux-headers

        Explanation: This command shows the version of the installed kernel headers. The headers are used for compiling kernel modules, so they need to match the running kernel version for modules to be properly built.

Why Kernel Version and Headers Must Match:

The kernel headers are a set of files required to compile kernel modules (such as the evdi module for DisplayLink). When you compile a module, the build process uses these headers to ensure compatibility between the module and the running kernel.

    Matching Kernel Version: The kernel version (uname -r) tells you which kernel you’re using, while the kernel headers need to match that version so that the module is built correctly for that kernel. If the headers don't match the running kernel, the module may fail to compile or load properly, leading to errors.

For example, if you are running kernel version 6.12.1-arch1-1 and the headers installed are for 6.10.3-arch1-2, the module will likely not build correctly because the source files in the headers may be different.

To avoid these issues, it's crucial to ensure that both the kernel version and the headers are the same.
