/// Running wallpaper at startup

To ensure the wallpaper is set each time you start Hyperland, add the commands to start the swww daemon and set the wallpaper in your Hyperland startup script. Typically, this script is located at ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf or ~/.config/hypr/exec-once.sh.

Add the following lines to your startup script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/sh

# Start swww daemon
swww init

# Set the wallpaper
swww img ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg
