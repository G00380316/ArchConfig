Some things to note and do when you finish using the scripts install.sh in first normal and then sudo and then util.sh in sudo.

Some files may be out of place so you should read the script in order to know where they ought to acually be.

After you have made sure everything is in the right place

It is must likely that the Nerd font folder didnt make it to its destintation so make sure its in the fonts folder in local/share

next in the terminal just run this command in (Don't believe it has to be in that folder too)

/// Clears cache and caches andy new fonts

fc-cache -fv

///

After you done that after reboot your font should be in place next work on the bluetoothConfig and wifi Conifig files to make sure you have all the necessary dependecies to get waybar fully working 

you will have to go to the waybar folder in terminal by "cd .config/waybar" and then first you have to build the script there like you have been doing install.sh and util.sh this allows waybar to access it when you click on the icon that triggers it which is the network icon 

so if you want from home you can run this 

chmod +x ./.config/waybar/networkmanager.sh

or cd into it and just run

chmod +x ./networkmanager.sh

next cd into the waybar-module-pomodoro dir

run this command 

/// Builds the Rust exe 

cargo build --release 

now after this it should be working waybar fully with clickable buttons on the left hand side I advise looking at .bashrc to make sure some variables are the right ones for your system and also hyprland.conf

So you might run into a problem with the rust binary just make sure you export its path in ".bash_profile" and it should work fine 

For the nividia setup I will add the command to build and will just give you the files to then move to directories or you can use the commands and text to input into files below or the screenshot and use files as an example

sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

MODULES=(... nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm ...)

^^^ Paste this the text in between the dots in the module array in your file and if you already have modules in the array just leave a space and then paste 

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf

options nvidia_drm modeset=1 fbdev=1

^^^ Paste this into the conf file then run the command below to build the conf file

sudo mkinitcpio -P

and then reboot

After this I can't really remember if there is anymore so if there is please notify and I will tell you what to do on ezea128@gmail.com
