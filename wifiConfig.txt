This is to install wifi manager that works with iwd you should have every base package needed from the install.sh script but you will need to configure NetworkManager to use iwd

so type this command in terminal

sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

and paste these lines 

[device]
wifi.backend=iwd

and then go back to terminal and run this command 

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager

The network manager should now be working with your system and waybar this is a iwd setup btw so make sure you don't have any other conflicting packages

// Useful commands for iwd 

iwctl

device list
station wlan0 show 
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect "ROUTER_SSID"
