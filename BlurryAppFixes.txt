So I put potential fixes for flathub/flatpak apps through flatSeal and I'm not sure if this may work with them or its like the same thing but this I found
From downloading google chrome of the Arch Repositories using AUR Helper using "yay -S 'app-name'" the app was Google Chrome for reference 

so I installed it by "yay -S google-chrome" and when I ran goodle-chrome-stable it came up blurry. 

google-chrome-stable --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland

then figured out by running the line above I can use the wayland backend to run the application then next is to edit the desktop app file '.desktop' to exec
this line on open so these are the steps you can try this on any desktop apps to see you can fix the blur

'.desktop' files are usually in this directory "/usr/share/applications/"

sudo nano /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop

so probably best to use nano and edit it find the exec and then add this line instead 

Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland %U

ctrl + x to save and then use enter to confirm but keep in mind the name varies for each app and if there is more needed fixes for blurry Apps I will add here
